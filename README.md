## ♿ Accessibility

This app has been tested with **axe DevTools**, a browser extension that helps identify and fix accessibility issues in real time.

While the app supports many accessibility features (semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation), it's **not fully WCAG-compliant** yet — for example, **font resizing** is not implemented. This will be addressed in future updates.

**Accessibility features:**

- Keyboard-operable controls
- Clear contrast ratios
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels and roles

## Accessibility Considerations (WCAG)

### Focus Management

In compliance with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), our application ensures that all interactive elements such as input fields, buttons, and links are accessible to keyboard users and users with disabilities.

- **Focus on Click**: When a user clicks on input fields, it will receive focus, making it clear which element is currently selected.
- **Tab Key Navigation**: Users can navigate through the interactive elements using the `Tab` key. This allows users to move through the form inputs and buttons in a predictable order, ensuring a seamless experience for keyboard users.

### Why This Is Important:

- **WCAG 2.1, Guideline 2.4.3 (Focus Order)**: Ensures that interactive elements are focusable and navigable in a logical order.
- **WCAG 2.1, Guideline 2.4.7 (Focus Visible)**: Ensures that users can easily see which element is focused, improving usability for keyboard and screen reader users.

By implementing proper focus handling, we ensure that our application is accessible to a broader range of users, including those relying on keyboard navigation and screen readers.

## 🎨 Design Decisions and Reasoning

Throughout the development of this app, several design choices were made to enhance user experience, accessibility, and performance:

### 1. Color Contrast Adjustments for Sidebar:

One significant change was improving the color contrast of the sidebar. Initially, the contrast didn’t meet accessibility standards, and this was identified using the axe DevTools extension. Enhancing the color contrast ensures better readability for users with visual impairments, aligning with WCAG guidelines for accessibility.

### 2. Toast Notifications for Favorites:

To improve user feedback, I added a toast component to notify users when they add or remove news from their favorites. This enhances the UX by providing real-time feedback without interrupting the user's workflow, giving them assurance that their actions were successfully completed.

### 3. Login/Registration Modal Design:

Instead of navigating to a separate page, the login and registration process was implemented as a modal. The design was aligned with the app’s existing color scheme, ensuring a cohesive look and feel. This choice minimizes page reloads, keeping the user on the current page for a more fluid experience.

### 4. Skeleton Loader for News Loading:

Instead of a traditional loading spinner, I introduced a news skeleton loader. This modern approach simulates the layout of the news cards while they load, providing a smoother and more visually appealing experience. It also helps users understand the structure of the content while waiting for it to load, improving perceived performance.

- **Backend** is deployed on **Render**

Everything installs locally — no global packages are required.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

```

## 🔒 API Key

To use the New York Times API, you’ll need to sign up for an API key:

📌 [NYT Developer API](https://developer.nytimes.com/)

Add your API key to the \`.env\` file in the client directory:

```bash env
VITE_NYT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Why I Chose New York Times API Instead of News API

For my fullstack application (frontend built with React, backend with Node.js/Express), I decided to use the **New York Times API** instead of the **News API**, primarily for the following reasons:

---

#### 1. Limitations of the Free News API Plan

The free version of News API **does not allow usage in production** – it explicitly forbids displaying content to end users through publicly available applications. This was the main reason I couldn't use it during deployment.

---

#### 2. Deployment and Hosting

Since I planned to deploy the app online (e.g., using Vercel for the frontend and Render for the backend), it was essential to use an API that allows access in a **public environment**. The NYT API does **not restrict this kind of use** in its free tier, which made it more suitable for deployment and demo purposes.

---

#### 3. More Stable Free Usage Limits

The New York Times API offers **clear and stable limits** for the number of daily requests, which were sufficient for my development and testing needs. In contrast, News API has **stricter limitations**, and advanced features or production access require a paid plan.

---

#### 4. Legal Safety

By using the NYT API, I avoided potential issues with **licensing and terms of use violations**. This allowed me to deploy the app confidently, without having to hide the API or create workaround solutions.

## 📋 Future Improvements

- Font resizing to make the app more accessible for users with visual impairments.
- Further WCAG compliance improvements.
